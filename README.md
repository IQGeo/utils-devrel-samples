# Developer Relations Samples Project

This project provides several samples of functionalities for developers wanting to learn more about how to extend IQGeo applications.

This repository is based on the [utils-project-template](https://github.com/IQGeo/utils-project-template) repository. It is assumed that you already have access to a development environment, but if you need to set up your own environment, it should be based in the `utils-project-template` repository, and you can find more information on how to set it up in the `README.md` file of that repo.
