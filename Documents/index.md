# Developer Relations Samples Library

Welcome to the Developer Relations Samples Library documentation. Here you will find all the relevant documents for the samples created by IQGeo's Developer Relations Team

This project provides several samples of functionalities for developers wanting to learn more about how to extend IQGeo applications and is hosted in this [repository](https://github.com/JaySantosIQGeo/devrel-sample-library), which is based on the [utils-project-template](https://github.com/IQGeo/utils-project-template) repository. It is assumed that you already have access to a development environment, but if you need to set up your own environment, it should be based in the `utils-project-template` repository, and you can find more information on how to set it up in the `README.md` file of that repo.
